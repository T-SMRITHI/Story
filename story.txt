It was a very hot and sunny day. the trees danced in the wind making a hustling sound. i sat still on a bench staring at 
the green grass under the hot sun with my eyes wrinkled. Something important was on my mind. When an ant crawled over my leg, I realized that the time
was passing on. I looked at the pen and paper in my hand. I was thinking a story for the next chapter of my book.
Soon the weather turned cloudy. It was no more a sunny day. The shadow of the trees around me started to disappear.
The wind roared loudly. I was ready to face the upcoming storm. People started running to the lonely cafe a little far away. When I stood up, without my
senses, a page of the story flew away.
